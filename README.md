# About
This firmware is intended to run on an [Adafruit Huzzah32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405?gclid=CjwKCAjwwab7BRBAEiwAapqpTNLGoimt1a0aejPQzB4hz1qhI3nUAYYLYbnbMX2vcPdJj52Gd-DHHhoChNEQAvD_BwE) combined with the [Keyboard Featherwing](https://www.tindie.com/products/arturo182/keyboard-featherwing-qwerty-keyboard-26-lcd/). The results is an [ESP32 Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder) in the form factor of a blackberry. The biggest upside to using this method of creating a marauder is that Keyboard Featherwings are stocked more often than the [original ESP32 Marauder hardware on tindie](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk03xRzly6HJkmAm-p7fpgKwWICfzfQ%3A1600822282501&ei=CpxqX_qQHvrDytMP1KyG-AM&q=self+deprecation+definition&oq=self+dep&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAxgAMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHMgQIABBHUABYAGC4FmgAcAJ4AIABAIgBAJIBAJgBAKoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQjAAQE&sclient=psy-ab).
